				This part is the main function of the web application. Users can select
				a "month" from the left sidebar and a "week" from the right sidebar.
				Each week of different months has unique themes. I didn't design the
				styles myself; the designs were created by a designer who posted the PDF
				versions on Bilibili. I incorporated these designs into the web
				application using the technologies discussed in this report.
